                <h2>what is gif?</h2>
                <p>The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) is a bitmap image format that has come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web <br>
                    due to its wide support and portability between applications and operating systems. </p>
                <p>
                    The format supports up to 8 bits per pixel for each image, allowing a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256 <br>
                    different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It also supports animations and allows a separate palette of up to<br>
                    256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make GIF less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images<br>
                    with color gradients, but well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color. Unlike video, the <br>
                    GIF file format does not support audio.

                <h2>Why GIF banner?</h2>
                
                    <ul>
                    <li> 
                        banners are accepted by most publishers and ad networks – Ad networks like Google are accepting .gif banners. <br>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        They may contain animations – but these animation must be 30 seconds or shorter. <br>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Can tell relatively complex stories through slides 
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        They have a very low file size – As I already told you, these gif banners must be no bigger than 150kb. <br>
                    </li>
                   
                    <li>
                        They require no plug-ins for the users to view them. <br>
                    </li>
                  
                    <li>
                        GIF banners work well on mobile devices <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GIF banner ads are cool and interactive <br>
                    </li>
